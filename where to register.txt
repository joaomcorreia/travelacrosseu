## 💸 Where to sign up (realistic starter list)

### 1. **For showing ads on your site (Google Ads on pages = AdSense)**
You want to *show* ads on TravelAcrossEU → that’s **Google AdSense**, not Google Ads.
- **Sign up:** Google AdSense start page :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Requirements: you need your own original content and a site that follows AdSense policies :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

Later, you’ll:
- Place **2–3 responsive ad units per page** (e.g., one in-content, one sidebar/footer, maybe one under hero).  
- Avoid stupid dark-pattern layouts and weird ad spam; that keeps UX clean and approval safer.

If you ever want to **pay to bring traffic** (instead of earning from ads), that’s **Google Ads** (different product): :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### 2. **Travel affiliate programs (for bookings & experiences)**
These are perfect for TravelAcrossEU — you recommend destinations, they handle bookings, you get a cut.

#### 🏨 Booking.com Affiliate
- Main partnerships hub (how to join, networks like Awin/CJ): :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

You’ll use:
- Hotel/accommodation links
- Search widgets
- Banners on key pages (e.g. “Hotels in Lisbon” page).

#### 🎟 GetYourGuide Affiliate (tours & activities)
- Travel affiliate/partner program: :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

Perfect for:
- City pages (e.g. “Things to do in Barcelona” → embed GetYourGuide tours).

#### ✈ Expedia Group Affiliate
- Expedia Group affiliate/creator program: :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

Use it for:
- Hotels, flights, car rentals, packages.

#### 🌐 CJ Affiliate (network hub)
- General affiliate network with many travel brands (including Booking.com via CJ): :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

Good for:
- Centralizing affiliate links
- Finding more travel-related partners later.

### 3. How I’d prioritize sign-ups **for you**

If you want to keep it lean and not drown in logins:

1. **Google AdSense** → for general display ads once content is up. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
2. **Booking.com affiliate** → hotels on destination pages. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
3. **GetYourGuide affiliate** → activities & tours, very good fit for “what to do” pages. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
4. **Expedia Group affiliate** → only if you still want more options later. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

We can design the placements later so it’s:
- Useful  
- Not spammy  
- And still passes Core Web Vitals / UX sanity.
