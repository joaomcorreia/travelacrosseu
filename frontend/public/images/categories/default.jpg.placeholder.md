# Default Category Image

This is a placeholder file explaining where to place the fallback category image.

## Required: default.jpg

Place a default category image here as `default.jpg` for the CategoriesSection fallback.

The image will be used when category.image is null or empty.

Recommended specs:
- Format: JPG or WebP
- Size: 1200x800px (3:2 aspect ratio) 
- Content: Generic European travel scene
- File size: < 200KB

Until this image is added, the component will fall back to CSS gradients with category initials.
