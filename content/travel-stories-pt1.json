    "body": "It was pouring when I arrived in Amsterdam. The kind of steady, unapologetic rain that makes you question why you even left the house. But something about the city in the rain feels different. The canals look deeper, the reflections brighter, and the streets quieter. I spent most of the day ducking into cafés, sipping warm drinks, watching bikes glide past with plastic bags tied over seats. It became one of the calmest days I've ever had in Europe.\n\nThe best part? A last-minute detour into a tiny record shop near De Pijp. No crowds, no rush — just the sound of soft jazz and rain on the window. Amsterdam is good in sunshine, but it’s unforgettable in rain.",
